{"title": "Distribution of human papilloma virus type 16 E6/E7 gene mutation in cervical precancer or cancer: A case control study in Guizhou Province, China.", "texts": ["HPV-16 varies geographically and is correlated with cervical cancer genesis and progression. This study aimed to determine the distribution of HPV-16 E6/E7 genetic variation in patients with invasive cervical cancer or precancer in Guizhou Province, China. A case-control study was designed, and the distribution of HPV-16 E6/E7 genetic variation was compared among women with cervical cancer, precancer, and sexually active without cervical lesion. HPV infection was detected through flow-through hybridization and gene chip techniques to determine the prevalence of HPV 16 E6/E7 genetic variation. Among 90 specimens (30 cervical cancer, 30 precancer, 30 controls), 81 were subjected to HPV-16 E6/E7 gene sequencing. The rates of DNA sequence mutation and amino acid mutation were 76.5% (62/81) and 66.7% (54/81), respectively. Both E6 and E7 genes showed higher mutation rate than their prototypes. The prevalence of E6/E7 mutation significantly differed between the cervical cancer and the controls (P < 0.05) and between the cervical precancer and the controls (P < 0.05). Mutations were simultaneously detected at the E6-D32E (T96A) and E7-M28V (A82G)/L94P (T281C) sites of the amino acid sequence. The most common genetic variation was D32E/M28V/L94P, which accounted for 35.8% of the cases (29/81). D32E/M28V/L94P mutation was higher in the cervical cancer and precancer compared with the prototype. HPV-16 E6/E7 genetic variations, such as D32E/M28V/L94P, are more prevalent in cervical cancer or precancer than those in the controls. The possible correlation between genetic variation and cancerigenesis may be used to design an HPV vaccine for cervical carcinoma."]}
