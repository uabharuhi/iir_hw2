{"title": "Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the allosteric effect of F1174C resistance mutation to ceritinib in ALK-associated lung cancer.", "texts": ["Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has become as an important target for the treatment of various human cancers, especially non-small-cell lung cancer. A mutation, F1174C, suited in the C-terminal helix Î±C of ALK and distal from the small-molecule inhibitor ceritinib bound to the ATP-binding site, causes the emergence of drug resistance to ceritinib. However, the detailed mechanism for the allosteric effect of F1174C resistance mutation to ceritinib remains unclear. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations [Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA)] were carried out to explore the advent of drug resistance mutation in ALK. MD simulations observed that the exquisite aromatic-aromatic network formed by residues F1098, F1174, F1245, and F1271 in the wild-type ALK-ceritinib complex was disrupted by the F1174C mutation. The resulting mutation allosterically affected the conformational dynamic of P-loop and caused the upward movement of the P-loop from the ATP-binding site, thereby weakening the interaction between ceritinib and the P-loop. The subsequent MM/GBSA binding free energy calculations and decomposition analysis of binding free energy validated this prediction. This study provides mechanistic insight into the allosteric effect of F1174C resistance mutation to ceritinib in ALK and is expected to contribute to design the next-generation of ALK inhibitors."]}
