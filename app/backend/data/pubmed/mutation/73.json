{"title": "[SOX10 mutation is relevant to inner ear malformation in patients with Waardenburg syndrome].", "texts": ["Objective: To determine the relevance between the SOX10 mutation and Waardenburg syndrome (WS) accompanied with inner ear abnormality by analyzing the inner ear imaging results and molecular and genetic results of the WS patients with the SOX10 mutation. Methods: This study included 36 WS in patients during 2001 and 2015 in the department of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery, Chinese Peoples's Liberation Army General Hospital. The condition of the inner ear of each patient was assessed by analyzing HRCT scans of the temporal bone and MRI scans of the brain and internal auditory canal. Meanwhile, the possible pathogenic genes of WS, including SOX10, MITF, and PAX3, were also screened. Patients were divided into two groups according to SOX10 mutation.The Fisher accuracy test was used to determine statistical difference of inner ear deformation incidence between the two groups. Results: Among all 36 patients, 12 were found to have inner ear abnormality. Most abnormalities were posterior semicircular canal deformations, some accompanied with cochlear deformation and an enlarged vestibule. Among all patients, 9 patients were SOX10 heterozygous mutation carriers, among which six showed bilateral inner ear abnormality. Fisher accuracy test results suggested a significant correlation between the SOX10 mutation and inner ear abnormality in WS patients (P=0.036). Conclusion: This study found that WS patients with the SOX10 mutation are more likely to have deformed inner ears when compared to WS patients without the SOX10 mutation."]}
