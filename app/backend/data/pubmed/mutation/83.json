{"title": "A novel MSX1 intronic mutation associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic oligodontia in a large Chinese family pedigree.", "texts": ["Tooth agenesis is a common developmental dental anomaly. The aim of the study was to identify the causal genetic mutation in a four-generation Chinese family affected with non-syndromic autosomal dominant tooth agenesis.", "Genome-wide scanning was performed using the Illumina Linkage-12 array. Genotyping of short tandem repeat markers was used to finely map the causative locus. Haplotype analysis and Sanger sequencing was performed to precisely locate the position and nature of the gene defect.", "Clinical examination of the available 23 family members showed variable tooth agenesis in 10 subjects, ranging from oligodontia to mild hypodontia. Genome-wide scanning and haplotype analyses identified the 4p16.1-p16.3 region with a maximum multi-point LOD score of 3.50, which overlapped with the MSX1 gene. A single heterozygous point mutation IVS1-5 G>A in the MSX1 gene was exclusively detected in the 10 family members affected with tooth agenesis. Sequencing of MSX1 cDNA revealed that the intronic mutation did not affect the normal splicing pattern of the pre-mRNA. However, real-time qPCR analysis of lymphocyte RNA showed that the level of MSX1 mRNA was significantly decreased in individuals heterozygous for the mutation.", "We identified and characterized a novel intronic mutation in the MSX1 gene in a large Chinese pedigree, adding to the small repertoire of MSX1 mutations associated with autosomal dominant tooth agenesis. We hypothesize that the variable degree of tooth agenesis observed in each affected individual may be due to sub-optimal levels of MSX1 expression during critical stages tooth development."]}
