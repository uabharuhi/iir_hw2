{"title": "Mitochondrial tRNAThr 15891C>G mutation was not associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy in Han Chinese patients.", "texts": ["Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were the most important causes of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). To date, approximately 25 LHON-associated mtDNA mutations have been identified in various ethnic populations. Three primary mutations, the 3460G > A, 11778G > A and 14484T > C, in genes encoding the subunits of respiratory chain complex I, were the most common LHON-associated mtDNA mutations. Moreover, secondary mutations in mt-tRNA genes have been reported increasingly to be associated with LHON, simply due to the high mutation rates of mt-tRNAs. There is a lack of functional analysis and a poor genetic evaluation of a certain mt-tRNA mutation, which failed to meet the classic pathogenicity scoring system. As a result, how to classify a pathogenic mutation in mt-tRNA gene became important for both geneticist and clinician to diagnosis the LHON or the suspicious of LHON. In this study, we reassessed the role of a point mutation in mt-tRNA(Thr) gene which had been reported to be a mutation associated with LHON, the pathogenicity of this mutation has been discussed in this context."]}
