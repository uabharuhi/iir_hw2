{"title": "[A novel mutation in KCNB1 gene in a child with neuropsychiatric comorbidities with both intellectual disability and epilepsy and review of literature].", "texts": ["Objective: To explore the association between the phenotype and KCNB1 gene mutation. Method: Clinical information including physical features, laboratory and genetic data of one patient of mental retardation with refractory epilepsy from Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital in January 2016 was analyzed. This patient was discovered to have KCNB1 gene mutations through whole exome sequencing. Relevant information about KCNB1 gene mutation was searched and collected from Pubmed, CNKI, Human Gene Mutation Database(HGMD) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man(OMIM). Searching was done using \"KCNB1\" as a keyword. Result: A 3.5 years old boy who visited our hospital firstly at the age of 2 years because of development delay came for follow up as he developed seizures.The forms included tonic, clonic seizures and spasm. The condition became more severe 10 months later. Electroencephalogram(EEG) showed high frequency discharge (>85%). He had poor response to multiple anti-epileptic drugs, methylprednisolone and ketogenic diet. At the age of 3, he started to have mental regression. Whole exome-sequencing study (trios) identified a novel heterozygous mutation c. G1136T (p.G379V) in KCNB1, which is not available in the databases mentioned above. This is the first case report of KCNB1 gene mutation in China. Eight cases have been reported so far worldwide and all of them were diagnosed with refractory epilepsy. Those 8 reported cases of encephalopathy were all due to de novo mutation. Conclusion: The main clinical features of patients with KCNB1 mutations include severe to profound intellectual disability, intractable seizures, hypotonia and regression of cognition and motor activity which lead to poor prognosis."]}
