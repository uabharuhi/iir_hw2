Given the long-term health consequences of premature surgical menopause, we need insight in uptake and timing of RRSO to guide us in improving healthcare.", "A single-center retrospective cohort study of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers diagnosed and counseled at the multidisciplinary Family Cancer Clinic of the Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, between 1999 and 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze uptake and timing of RRSO.", "Data of 580 BRCA1/2 were analyzed. The uptake of RRSO among mutation carriers who are currently above the upper limit of the recommended age for RRSO, is 98.5% and 97.5% for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively. The vast majority undergoes RRSO ≤40 (BRCA1) or ≤45 (BRCA2) years of age, provided that mutation status is known by that age: 90.8% and 97.3% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively.", "The uptake of RRSO among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were counseled at our Family Cancer Clinic is extremely high. High uptake might be largely attributed to the directive and uniform way of counseling by professionals at our Family Cancer Clinic. Given the fact that RRSO is often undergone at premenopausal age in our population, future research should focus on minimizing long-term health consequences of premature surgical menopause either by optimization of hormone replacement therapy or by investigating alternative strategies to RRSO."]}
