{"title": "The Frequency of EGFR Mutation in Lung Adenocarcinoma and the Efficacy of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in a Hungarian Cohort of Patients.", "texts": ["In the last decades new therapeutic drugs have been developed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) significantly increase the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with NSCLC carrying epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. This type of lung cancer occurs mainly among non-smoking women and Asian origin. However, the new ESMO guideline recommends EGFR mutation analysis in every patient with NSCLC, because in patients with activating EGFR mutation, TKIs should be considered as first line therapy. In our recent work, we analyzed data of patients with EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma from January 2009. The number of patients investigated was 446, among them 44 cases were positive for EGFR mutation. The ratio of positive cases was 9.86 % that is lower than the average mutation rate in Europe and much lower than that found in Asia. The exon 19 deletion was detected in 61.4 % of the patients, while L858R point mutation in exon 21 was observed in 34.1 % of them. In one subject, both exon 19 and 21 mutations were present simultaneously. A rare mutation located in exon 21 was found in another patient. TKI therapy was conducted in 38 patients. The disease control rate by TKI therapy was 85.7 %; primary resistance was documented in five subjects. Non-smoking patients with EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma had the highest benefit from TKI treatment. Our data support the recommendation that EGFR mutation status should be defined in all cases of locally advanced or metastatic lung adenocarcinoma."]}
